    <center><h2>FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h2> <p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p></center>
   <center> 
   <p>Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end. <br>The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.</p>

<p>The main components of a full stack development are the front-end, back-end and database</p>
<p>Consider a retail website. Users can browse or purchase specific items, delete or add items in cart, change their profile, and <br>do many other things. All these actions require a front-end user interface (UI), as well as some business logic, written in the back-end.</p>

<li>The website UI can be built using various, front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript.</li>
<li> The back end is written in programming languages like Java or Python. Further, a good web application <br>would need scalability, event handling, and routing, which are usually handled by libraries and frameworks like SpringBoot or Django.</li>
<li>The back end also consists of logic that can connect the application to other services and databases. <br>For example, all the user and transaction data is stored in a database through specific drivers handled on the back end.</li>

<p>A full stack developer is one who can single-handedly implement both the front-end and back-end workflows, like placing the order<br> or changing the user profile.</p>

<h2>What is a full stack developer and what do they do?</h2>
<p>Full stack developers must have knowledge of an entire technology stack, i.e., the set of technologies that are used <br>to build an end-to-end application quickly and efficiently. For example, if they want to build an application using the MEAN stack, <br>they should know how to work with MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.</p>
<p>Full stack developers should be able to judge whether the selected technologies are the right choice for their <br>project during the early phases. Some responsibilities of a full stack developer are to:</p>

<p>Help in choosing the right technologies for the project development and testing both on the front end and the back end.</p>
<p>Write clean code across the stack by following the best practices of the tools used.</p>
<p>Be up to date with the latest technologies and tools to make the best technology usage decisions.</p>
